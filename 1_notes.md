 NOTES: THE SYMPATHETIC INNERVATION OF THE HEART
================================================

Anatomy
-------

1.  Pre-ganglionic neurons

    a.  Brain stem

        i.  Medullary dorsolateral reticular formation

    b.  Spinal cord

        ii. Overview

            1.  Lateral horns of the T1-T12 and L1-L3 spinal cord
                (thoracolumbar outflow)

            2.  Synapse on sympathetic ganglia or on chromaffin cells of
                adrenal gland to release epinephrine (EPI)

            3.  Cardiac nerves originate from T1-T6, exiting spinal cord
                from ventral roots into the white rami to join the
                sympathetic chain, including stellate ganglion (SG)

    c.  Sympathovagal balance

        iii. Vagal afferent stimuli, e.g. baroreceptors, can lead to
            central sympathetic efferent activity (either inhibition or
            excitation)

        iv. Local neurotransmitter effects also present (e.g. galanin
            inhibits cholinergic nerves)

    d.  Extracardiac

        v.  Preganglionic neurons are found in the brain stem at the
            medullary dorsolateral reticular formation (mainly vagus),
            and the T1-T6 lateral horns of the spinal cord
            (sympathetic).

        vi. Myocardium is directly innervated by sympathetic neurons,
            mainly found in cervical, stellate, and thoracic ganglia
            (both afferent and efferent paths are present)

2.  Post-ganglionic neuron -- sympathetic ganglia

    e.  Overview

        vii. Paravertebral

            4.  Cervical region x 3, including left and right SG,
                thoracic region x 10-11, lumbar region x 4, sacral
                region x 4, coccyx x 1 (midline)

            5.  SG nerves are purely sympathetic fibers

            6.  Sympathetic nerves on the left mainly distribute to the
                epicardial surface of left ventricle, and endocardial
                surface of both ventricles(Stee, 1978)

        viii. Prevertebral - axons are distributed to the 3 major
            gastrointestinal arteries arising from the aorta

        ix. Neurotransmitter - predominantly nor epinephrine (NE)

    f.  Firing rate

        x.  Thoracic spinal segments have a distinct cardiac rhythm and
            other oscillatory frequencies that are reproduced in cardiac
            postganglionic neurons. Analyses shows there are
            periodicities from 2-6 Hz, 10 Hz, respiratory rates, and
            slower oscillations (\~0.3 Hz) called Mayer
            waves.(Malpas, 1998)

        xi. Afferent postganglionic neurons increase firing with
            increases in chamber pressure, and decrease discharge with
            decreased pressure. Similarly, higher firing rate with
            increase coronary flow, and decreased rate with decreased
            coronary flow (based on chamber). Ischemia only led to
            increase discharge of fibers when accompanied by heart
            failure.(A. Malliani, Recordati, & Schwartz, 1973)

3.  Cardiac innervation

    g.  Overview

        xii. Sympathetic nerve fibers are located subepicardially and
            travel along major coronary arteries.

        xiii. Sympathetic fibers enter the heart close to the pulmonary
            vessels

        xiv. Ventricular sympathetic innervations is characterized by a
            gradient from base to apex, with highest NE concentration in
            apex.(Pierpont, DeMaster, Reynolds, Pederson, & Cohn, 1985)

        xv. Majority of sympathetic postganglionic axons innervating the
            heart originate from cell bodies in the stellate ganglion

    h.  Left versus right innervation

        xvi. In rat heart, NE concentration measurements show that left
            middle/inferior SG contributes to the RV(Pardini, Lund, &
            Schmid, 1989)

        xvii. Stellate ganglion

            7.  RSG affects anterior/basal portion of ventricles; LSG
                has more effect on posterior/apical portion, as well as
                anterior LV wall (although both LSG/RSG contribute)
                (Vaseghi et al., 2012)

            8.  LSG stimulation leads to increased inotropy due to
                effects at ventricle; RSG stimulation leads to
                chronotropy d/t atrial effects (Ajijola et al., 2015;
                Winter, Tanko, Brack, Coote, & Ng, 2012)

            9.  Stimulation of the LSG leads to inotropic
                response.(Pardini et al., 1989) Stimulation of the RSG
                leads to chronotropic response.(Stee, 1978)

    i.  Intrinsic cardiac plexus

        xviii.  Postganglionic neurons interact with local plexus
            neurons, along with parasympathetic neuron interactions

        xix. The majority of the ganglia are organized into ganglionated
            plexuses (GP) on the surface of the atria and ventricle,
            containing 200-1000 neurons each, that form synapses with
            sympathetic/parasympathetic fibers that enter the
            pericardial space.(Armour, Murphy, Yuan, Macdonald, &
            Hopkins, 1997)

        xx. ﻿From the GP, they extend epicardially to innervate the
            atria, interatrial septum, and the ventricles.(Pauza,
            Skripka, Pauziene, & Stropus, 2000)

            10. Arterial

                a.  Left coronary subplexus: arterial hilum by the
                    pulmonary trunk

                b.  Right coronary subplexus: arterial hilum by the
                    aorta

            11. Venous

                c.  Dorsal right atrial subplexus: right caudal vein or
                    SVC and supplies the SA node and dorsum of RA

                d.  Middle dorsal subplexus: branches from pulmonary
                    veins into the coronary groove

                e.  Left dorsal subplexus: terminates on dorsal left
                    atrial and ventricular regions

                f.  Ventral left atrial subplexus: begins by the left
                    pulmonary vein and joins the ventral left atrial
                    region

                g.  Right ventral subplexus: ventromedial aspect of the
                    SVC to the ventrial right atrium

        xxi. Majority of the GP neuronal bodies are on supraventricular
            tissues, laying flat on epicardial surface but also within
            fat pads on the heart hilum.(Wake & Brack, 2016) Most common
            locations include :

            12. Dorsal atria surface

            13. Base of aorta and pulmonary artery

            14. Dorsal and ventral to pulmonary veins

            15. Anterior ventricular surface

        xxii. The inferior wall of the left ventricle has a higher
            proportion of vagal afferent neurons, such that inferior
            ischemia, usually from the RCA system, leads to a
            cardioinhibitory pattern and subsequent sinus bradycardia.
            (Walker, Thames, Abboud, Mark, & Kloppenstein, 1978) In
            humans, imaging shows a consistent pattern of increased
            vagal innervation of the inferior wall, based on MIBG uptake
            in the myocardium. (Morozumi et al., 1997)

        xxiii.  Sympathetic nerves travel along major coronary arteries
            as a plexus, and decrease in proportion to vessel size to 2
            single fibers at level of arterioles. (Dolezel, Gerová,
            Gero, Sládek, & Vasku, 1978)

    j.  Sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes

        xxiv. Increased sympathetic efferent firing leads to increase in
            sinus rate and shortens AV nodal conduction. Also it
            shortens action potential duration (APD) and reduced
            transmural dispersion of repolarization.(Winter, Brack, &
            Ng, 2011; Winter, Tanko, Brack, Coote, & Ng, 2012)

    k.  Efferent

        xxv. Postganglionic neurons are found in ganglionated plexuses
            (GPs) that are on epicardium, are location for the
            interaction between sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers
            as well as interneurons. Epicardiac GPs are consistent from
            heart to heart in humans.

        xxvi. Generally, RA is innervated by 2 GPs, the LA by 3, the RV
            by 1, and the LV by 3. Highest density if GPs are near the
            hilum of the heart, mainly dorsal surface of the LA (contain
            up to 50% of cardiac ganglia). (Pauza, Skripka, Pauziene, &
            Stropus, 2000)

        xxvii.  Ventricular sympathetic innervations is characterized by
            a gradient from base to apex, with highest NE concentration
            in apex. (Pierpont, DeMaster, Reynolds, Pederson, &
            Cohn, 1985)

        xxviii.   Innervation is seen through all 4 chambers and
            endocardial/myocardial/epicardial layers, highest density in
            epicardium and decreasing to endocardium. Cholinergic nerves
            have a right-to-left density gradient in the endocardium
            only. Adrenergic nerves mainly found in atrial GP, also had
            right-to-left gradient only in endocardium. Epicardial
            tissue had ventricular-to-atrial gradient of adrenergic
            nerves. (Crick, Anderson, Ho, & Sheppard, 1999)

    l.  Afferent

        xxix. Ventricular sensory neurons are mainly sympathetic
            afferents -- triggered most powerfully by chemical stimuli
            (even after chemical removed), and mechanical stimuli.
            (Armour, Huang, Pelleg, & Sylvén, 1994)

4.  Gross anatomy

    m.  Right atrium

        xxx. The right atrial GP were sampled through epicardial fat
            biopsy during cardiothoracic surgery, and then visualized
            through immunofluorescent staining. Most neuronal somata
            contained ChAT and NOS. A subpopulation contained TH
            (noradrenergic markers). Although most neurons received
            cholinergic inputs, some were absent. (Hoover et al., 2009)

    n.  Left ventricle

        xxxi. The mid-myocardium has a higher-concentration of nitrergic
            (NOS) fibers compared to cholinergic (ChAT) by a factor
            of 8.

    o.  Pulmonary veins

        xxxii.  Innervated by three epicardial GPs in humans: ﻿the
            dorsal right atrial, middle dorsal and left dorsal
            subplexuses, with an estimated 2000 neurons residing at the
            base of each PV. (Vaitkevicius et al., 2009)

5.  Imaging techniques

    p.  Fluorodopamine can be used to image sympathetic innervation of
        the heart. The predominance of visualization of tracer is the in
        the ventricles, homogenously, and slightly higher in the
        interventricular septum.(Armando et al., 2010)

Chemical interactions
---------------------

1.  Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)

    a.  Cholinergic cell bodies predominate cardiac nerves. ChAT make up
        60-100% of cardiac ganglia. ChAT somata most common in atria
        compared to rest of heart.

2.  Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and nor epinephrine (NE)

    b.  Neurons responsible for NE production. 10-20% of all neurons
        contain both TH and ChAT. Both left and right coronary plexuses
        are adrenergic. (Pauza et al., 2013; Pauziene et al., 2016)

    c.  NE bind to both alpha and beta receptors -- A2AR exist on
        varicosities on sympathetic neurons, leading to negative
        feedback to decrease NE release. (Shcherbakova et al., 2007)

3.  Neuropeptide Y (NPY)

    d.  Released along with NA, and attenuates effects of vagal
        bradycardia, through decrease in release of ACh.(Herring,
        Lokale, Danson, Heaton, & Paterson, 2008) Acutely potent
        coronary vasoconstrictor; may lead to angiogenesis in long-term.
        (Herring, 2015)

    e.  NPY leads to mild constriction of epicardial arteries for all
        patients. In microvascular angina (clean LHC, +PET), NPY leads
        to transient myocardial ischemia. (Rosano et al., 2017)

4.  Nitric oxide synthase (NOS)

    f.  Makes NO, co-transmitter that modulates vagal effect to increase
        VF threshold (through modifying APD). Co-localizes with ChAT
        somata, present equally from endocardium to epicardium of LV,
        but density is basal \> apical. (Brack, Patel, Coote, &
        Ng, 2007)

5.  Galanin

    g.  Galanin is released alongside NPY, acts by inhibiting
        cholinergic nerves to reduce ACh release. Galanin receptors
        (GalR1) are found on ChAT somata/synapses (may mediate the
        breaking of vagal bradycardia). (Herring et al., 2012)

    h.  Galanin is co-expressed in \~5% of TH neurons in the stellate.
        After injury (e.g. ischemia), levels increase to almost all
        neurons after 3 days. (Herring et al., 2012)

    i.  GalR1 is expressed at SA node.

6.  Cardiomyocytes

    j.  B1 and B2 adrenergic receptors are present in cardiac myocytes
        at sympathetic synaptic terminals; B1AR accumulate at synapses,
        while B2AR undergo endocytosis/internalization. (Shcherbakova et
        al., 2007) Beta-agonists lead to increase in cardiac mass
        through increased size of cardiac myocytes. (Franzoso, Zaglia, &
        Mongillo, 2016; Zaglia et al., 2013)

    k.  Almost all cardiomyocytes are in contact with sympathetic
        neurons (similar proportion to contact c- capillaries). (Hirsch
        et al., 2013) Basal/trophic sympathetic release leads to
        cardiomyocyte eutrophy (loss of beta-agonism leads to atrophy).

[Function]{.underline}

7.  Coronary baroreceptor

    l.  Baroreceptor reflex vagally mediated: high coronary pressure
        leads to sympathetic inhibition, but low pressures lead to
        delayed/slow efferent sympathetic outflow/vasoconstriction.
        (Drinkhill, Mcmahon, & Hainsworth, 1996; McMahon, Drinkhill, &
        Hainsworth, 1996)

8.  Coronary blood flow

    m.  Sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction can be attenuated/blocked
        by adenosine. (Abe, Morgan, & Gutterman, 1997)

    n.  Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased coronary
        vasodilation based on NE content of sympathetic nerve terminals
        (LAD \> LCx \> RCA), but only in cardiac transplant patients.
        (Di Carli et al., 2002) Suggest EC influences on IC may exist.

    o.  Innervated by both adrenergic and cholinergic neurons. Smaller
        arteries/arterioles contain more nerve terminals than larger
        coronary arteries. (Lever, Ahmed, & Irvine, 1965)

    p.  B1AR predominantly in larger coronary conduit arteries
        (B1AR:B2AR in \~2:1 ratio) \> 100 µm, while in smaller coronary
        arteries \< 100 µm, B1AR \~= B2AR. (Murphree & Saffitz, 1988)
        B1AR stimulation leads to vasodilation, while A1AR leads to
        vasoconstriction. (Baumgart et al., 1999) May exist to limit
        large vessel "steal" during ischemia.

9.  Electrical conduction

    q.  Chronotropy/dromotropy

        i.  SA node firing rate depends on "funny current", which has
            inward-rectifying Na+ current that leads to depolarization
            through the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic
            nucleotide-gated channel (HCN). Sympathetic tone leads to
            dromotropy/chronotropy through increased HCN activity,
            spontaneous SA depolarization rate, and sarcoplasmic
            reticulum release of Ca++, as well increased depolarization
            through other neuronal bundles (e.g. His bundle, AV node,
            etc). (Franzoso et al., 2016; Liao, Lockhead, Larson, &
            Proenza, 2010)

    r.  Repolarization

        ii. Effective refractory period (ERP) are shorted by sympathetic
            excitation, while sympathetic inhibition prolongs ERP...
            similar in endocardium/epicardium. (Martins & Zipes, 1980)
            Transmural dispersion of repolarization also shortened by
            sympathetic activity, prolonged by beta-blockade. (Dukes &
            Vaughan Williams, 1984)

10. Myocardial contractility

    s.  NE release by the heavily sympathetically-innervated myocardium
        leads to Ca++ channel activity and ryanodine receptor (RyR),
        which leads to increased cytosolic Ca++. Effect is increased
        inotropy/lusitropy. (Shan et al., 2010) Sympathetic stimuli with
        NE at SA node also leads to increased myocardial interstitial
        levels of NE, which lead to ventricular inotropy.

11. Sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes

    a.  Increased sympathetic efferent firing leads to increase in sinus
        rate and shortens AV nodal conduction. Also it shortens action
        potential duration (APD) and reduced transmural dispersion of
        repolarization.(Winter et al., 2011, 2012)

12. Atria

    b.  Parasympathetic fibers have different effect in ventricles
        compared to atria. In the atria, it decrease action potential
        and reduce effective refractory period ( ERP), and enhance
        spatial electrophysiological heterogeneity.(Coote &
        Chauhan, 2016)

13. Ventricles

    c.  Parasympathetic fibers have a potent anti-arrhythmic effect.

    d.  Dogma previously taught that cardiotropic sympathetic ganglia
        resided in paravertebral chains and differentially innervated
        the left and right ventricle.

    e.  RSG block or LSG stimulation both lead to prolonged QT and
        increased TW amplitude. LSG block or RSG stimulation have no
        measurable change in QT. RSG block leads to prolonged refractory
        period in anterior ventricle, while LSG block prolonged
        refractory period of posterior surface.

14. Ganglionated plexuses (GP)

    f.  Multiple locations exist and depend on the animal model. When
        nicotine is injected into the RAGP, three changes can occurs: i)
        bradycardia followed by tachycardia; ii) bradycardia alone; iii)
        tachycardia alone. This suggests that a biphenotypic response is
        possible within a GP.(Cardinal, Pagé, Vermeulen, Ardell, &
        Armour, 2009)

    g.  After using nicotine injections, and subsequently by blocking GP
        activity using hexamethonium, its suggested that GP have certain
        functions. The RA GP modulate vagal control, the IVC/LA GP AV
        modulates AV conduction, and the CMV (cranial medial
        ventricular) GP modulate LV inotropy.(Dickerson et al., 1998;
        Gatti et al., 1995; Gray, Johnson, Ardell, & Massari, 2004)

        i.  However, ablation of a single GP doesn't abolish its
            theoretical effect. For example, ablation of the RAGP leads
            to blunting of the initial tachycardic response, but doesn't
            stop the prolonged secondary tachycardia that occurs. This
            is because the SA node is innervated by the RAGP and
            additional GPs.

    h.  Communicating interneurons are also notable for transmitting
        afferent multimodal sensations into mechanical efferent signals
        that can induce atrial fibrillation.(Beaumont et al., 2013)

15. Coronary arteries

    i.  Innervated by both adrenergic and cholinergic neurons. Smaller
        arteries/arterioles contain more nerve terminals than larger
        coronary arteries. (Lever, Ahmed, & Irvine, 1965)

    j.  B1AR predominantly in larger coronary conduit arteries
        (B1AR:B2AR in \~2:1 ratio) \> 100 µm, while in smaller coronary
        arteries \< 100 µm, B1AR \~= B2AR. (Murphree & Saffitz, 1988)
        B1AR stimulation leads to vasodilation, while A1AR leads to
        vasoconstriction. (Baumgart et al., 1999) May exist to limit
        large vessel "steal" during ischemia.

[Reflex arches]{.underline}

1.  Aortic arches (SNS inhibition)(Alberto Malliani, Pagani, Pizzinelli,
    Furlan, & Guzzetti, 1983)

    a.  When the thoracic aortic diameter is increased, there is a
        reflex increase in aortic pressure

        i.  An increase of the aortic segment by 9 mm from 16 mm, there
            was an increase in MAP by 31 mm Hg from 100 mm Hg, and an
            increase in HR by 20 bpm from 90 bpm. HR changes were due to
            vagolysis (after vagotomy, resting HR was higher and no
            further increase in HR occurred by aortic stretch).(Pagani,
            Pizzinelli, Bergamaschi, & Malliani, 1982)

2.  Carotid baroreceptors (SNS inhibition)

    b.  Including Bezold-Jarish reflex

    c.  After stellate/spinal block, anesthesia-induced hypotension
        won't correct for low-pressure baroreceptor stimuli (vagal
        afferent), leaving unopposed vagal tone. (Crystal & Salem, 2012)

3.  Cardiovascular low-threshold polymodal receptors (SNS activation)

4.  Coronary baroreceptor

    d.  Baroreceptor reflex vagally mediated: high coronary pressure
        leads to sympathetic inhibition, but low pressures lead to
        delayed/slow efferent sympathetic outflow/vasoconstriction.
        (Drinkhill, Mcmahon, & Hainsworth, 1996; McMahon, Drinkhill, &
        Hainsworth, 1996)

1.  Heart failure

    a.  Increased sympathetic tone in ischemic HF models (porcine)
        improves myocardial contraction, decreased oxygen consumption,
        decreases intraventricular desynchrony, all without elevation of
        NE.(Liu et al., 2012)

    b.  After developing late-stage HF, neuronal bodies become
        hypertrophied and edematous. They become less excitable and may
        lead to vagal withdrawal. (Singh et al., 2013)

    c.  In both ischemic and dilated CM...B1 receptor downregulation
        (proportion of subtypes are the same compared to healthy).
        Transmural distribution is different, c- lower B1 receptors
        found in subendocardium. (Beau, Tolley, & Saffitz, 1993)

    d.  Cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) causes minimal
        increase in contractility, but has increased peripheral
        vasoconstriction (compared to rat controls). CSAR can be
        inhibited by epicardial lidocaine -- decreased contractility
        more in HF rats than control (also caused drop in LVEDP
        paradoxically). (Wang, Rozanski, & Zucker, 2017)

2.  Atrial fibrillation (AF)

    e.  GP around the PV are increased in activity during and preceding
        AF, and may be culprit. Thus ablations have a beneficial effect,
        although other GPs farther from the PV also show increased
        activity during AF. (Lu et al., 2009)

    f.  Paroxysmal AF (pAF) can be induced by simultaneous discharge of
        both limbs of the ANS, as it leads to imbalance. Initially there
        is adrenergic surge, followed by vagal predominance. (Bettoni &
        Zimmermann, 2002) Thought to also play a role in termination of
        pAF... these are hearts that have no structural disease. (Tomita
        et al., 2003) pAF was triggered by rapid firing from within
        pulmonary veins, which is preceded by tachycardia-pause
        initiation leading to increased EAD. (Patterson et al., 2007)

    g.  Extrinsic cardiac nervous system decreases AT/AF burden. When
        ablating GP that connects intrinsic to extrinsic, AT/AF went up
        chronically in a dog model. The "head" GP in dogs is by the
        SVC-Ao. (Lo et al., 2013)

3.  Ventricular fibrillation

    h.  Long QT syndromes: Increased beta-agonism leads to torsades de
        pointe (Tdp) d/t increased dispersion of depolarization or
        afterdepolarizations. (Shimizu & Antzelevitch, 1998)

    i.  Sympathetic stimulation leads to decrease in VF threshold.
        (Lown, 1979; Opthof et al., 1991)

4.  Myocardial ischemia (MI)

    j.  MI lead to intrinsic cardiac neuronal remodeling. After MI,
        there is an immediate and persistent increase in neurons that
        express NOS. NA injections lead to increased intracardiac GP
        excitability, which was subsequently augmented post-MI.
        (Hardwick, Ryan, Beaumont, Ardell, & Southerland, 2014)

    k.  Transmural ischemia, hitting epicardial layer (without
        collaterals like in dogs), triggers sympathetic afferent
        activity = leads to excitatory outflow. (Anthony J Minisi &
        Thames, 1991). Left ventricular wall has asymmetric
        sympathovagal innervation: vagal afferent preferentially
        distribute to inferior-posterior LV wall, sympathetic afferent
        are equally distributed (tested by inducing ischemia). (A J
        Minisi & Thames, 1993)

    l.  Transmural ischemia leads to sympathetic/vagal afferent
        denervation within 90 minutes after infarct. The afferents
        travel apical-to-basal, as nerves basal to infarct still
        functioned. (Barber, Mueller, Davies, Gill, & Zipes, 1985)
        Non-transmural ischemia maintains a response to bradykinin.
        (Inoue, Skale, & Zipes, 1988) Transmural ischemia leads to loss
        of efferent sympathetic nerves in non-infarcted apical regions
        within 20 minutes. (Inoue & Zipes, 1988)

    m.  Areas of cardiac tissue that have lost sympathetic innervation
        have supersensitive shortening of ERP to stimuli (e.g. NE or
        cervical ganglia stimulation), and have increased VF events.
        (Inoue & Zipes, 1987)

    n.  Transmural infarct leads to sympathetic denervation
        (subendocardial ischemia may only damage vagal afferent). (Herre
        et al., 1988; Zipes, 1990) Afferent sympathetic/vagal
        denervation occurs within 90 minutes after infarct at site,
        which travel apical-to-basal. (Barber, Mueller, Davies, Gill, &
        Zipes, 1985) Non-transmural ischemia retains response to
        stimuli. (Inoue, Skale, & Zipes, 1988) Transmural ischemia leads
        to apical loss of efferent sympathetic nerves within 20 minutes.
        (Inoue & Zipes, 1988)

    o.  Areas of cardiac tissue that have lost sympathetic innervation
        have supersensitive shortening of ERP to stimuli (e.g. NE or
        cervical ganglia stimulation), and have increased VF events.
        (Inoue & Zipes, 1987)

    p.  Sympathetic efferent show different activity based on
        innervating ischemic vs non-ischemic territory. (Neely &
        Hageman, 1990)

    q.  Transmural ischemia, hitting epicardial layer (without
        collaterals like in dogs), triggers sympathetic afferent
        activity = leads to excitatory outflow. (Anthony J Minisi &
        Thames, 1991). Left ventricular wall has asymmetric
        sympathovagal innervation: vagal afferent preferentially
        distribute to inferior-posterior LV wall, sympathetic afferent
        are equally distributed (tested by inducing ischemia). (A J
        Minisi & Thames, 1993)

    r.  Ischemia leads to IC neuronal remodeling, with
        immediate/persistent increase in NOS-neurons, with
        hypersensitivity to NE stimuli (increase GP excitability,
        augmented post-MI). (Hardwick, Ryan, Beaumont, Ardell, &
        Southerland, 2014)

    s.  Response to ischemia can be denervation vs. hyperinnervation,
        leads to heterogenous sympathetic fibers (increased
        arrhythmogenesis). (Huang, Boyle, & Vaseghi, 2017) Nerve
        sprouting theory: increased sympathetic neurons lead to
        increased VT/VF in ischemia (induced by nerve growth factor in
        LSG), and in chronic myocardial ischemia, higher amount of LSG
        sympathetic nerve sprouting occurs. (Cao et al., 2000; Chen et
        al., 2001)

    t.  

5.  Stellate block

    u.  After stellate/spinal block, anesthesia-induced hypotension
        won't correct for low-pressure baroreceptor stimuli (vagal
        afferent), leaving unopposed vagal tone. (Crystal & Salem, 2012)

    v.  Left versus right block (on healthy/controls) showed no change
        in EF. LSG block however led to increased LVEDP and LVESP
        compared to right. (Lobato, Kern, Paige, Brown, & Sulek, 2000)
