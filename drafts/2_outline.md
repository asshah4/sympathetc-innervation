OUTLINE: THE SYMPATHETIC INNERVATION OF THE HEART
=================================================

1.  Introduction

    a.  Background

        i.  Neurocardiac axis mediates connection between brain and
            heart

    b.  Purpose

        i.  Teach clinicians that sympathetic nervous system is
            important in normal function as well as pathophysiologic
            states

        ii. Share how the heart and autonomic system was not built to
            respond to

        iii. Explore the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology
            relevance of sympathetic outflow to the heart

    c.  Objectives

        i.  Understand how the sympathetic nervous system innervates the
            heart

        ii. Understand how sympathetic tone effects the functions of the
            heart (such as chronotropy, inotropy, lusitropy, dromotropy)

        iii. Review how sympathetic dysfunction occurs in pathological
            states, such as VT/VF, MI, and stress cardiomyopathy.

2.  Anatomic and physiologic considerations

    a.  Overview of section

        i.  Sympathetic nervous system has three “distinct” levels, the
            brain and spinal cord, the thoracic/extracardiac ganglia,
            and the intrinsic cardiac nervous system

        ii. Carry both afferent and efferent information, integrates
            that at multiple levels

    b.  Spinal cord level

        i.  Spinal cord anatomy of preganglionic neurons location, and
            both proximal and distal connections to brain and
            postganglionic neurons

            1.  Automaticity and firing of these SNS neurons

        ii. Effect of cerebral/nervous influences on these preganglionic
            cell bodies

            1.  Examples include sympathetic storm from TBI, which leads
                to hyperactivation

            2.  Nervous activity (e.g. panic attack) on the
                preganglionic bodies (what is the connection/mechanism
                of communicatin)

        iii. Integration of systemic/peripheral reflex arcs into the
            spinal cord

            1.  Examples include vasovagal syncope, mesenteric ganglia
                response to stress, etc (lumbosacral outflow)

    c.  Thoracic, extracardiac level

        i.  Anatomy of the thoracic ganglia

            1.  Preganglionic fibers exit from DRG and enter white rami,
                then eventually form sympathetic chain and thoracic
                ganglia

            2.  T1 to T6 specifically are responsible for cardiac
                outflow

        ii. Stellate ganglia

            1.  Historic examples include stellectomy/ganglion block to
                help decrease VT/VF burden

            2.  Innervation of the heart is different between LSG and
                RSG, to some degree

    d.  Intrinsic cardiac level

        i.  Sympathetic nervous system is within GPs around epicardium
            of heart, particularly in epicardial fat pads.

        ii. Innervation of the cardiac chambers and wall

            1.  Epicardium is highest density of nerve fibers, which
                decrease as going into endocardium

            2.  Atria have different right-to-left innervation of both
                adrenergic and cholinergic nerves

            3.  Ventricles have a base-to-apex density gradient of
                adrenergic fibers, but barely any vagal fibers (except
                inferior wall)

        iii. Coronary artery innervation goes from a plexus around
            major/large arteries, and decreases in size until it is only
            1-2 nerves at level of arteriole

3.  Ventricular fibrillatory threshold

    a.  Pertinent history of SCD

        i.  SCD occurs with increased sympathetic tone

            1.  Historical studies about emotional and stress triggers

        ii. Lown et al showed increased SNS leads to VT/VF in humans

        iii. Increased PVC during times of stress and increased SNS
            activity in human recordings

        iv. VF threshold is modulated by different factors (mainly SNS
            activity)

            1.  Increased likelihood of ventricular dysrhythmias of the
                heart

    b.  Normal effects of sympathetic tone through stellate ganglia
        stimulation

        i.  Increased SNS (e.g. stellate stimulation) leads to increased
            inotropy/lusitropy

        ii. RSG stimulation leads to increased SA firing, thus increased
            chronotropy/dromotropy

        iii. Increased stimulation leads to increased episodes of VT/VF
            (excluding effects of ischemia)

4.  Coronary perfusion

    a.  Myocardial infarction/ischemia

        i.  Advent of MI can change and increase VT/VF events

        ii. Infarction leads to rewiring of the heart, including NE
            release

        iii. Beta blockers, CCU “quiet and calm” can prevent sympathetic
            dysregulation

    b.  Cardiac innervation heterogeneity

        i.  Localized changes occur after infarct, included denervation

            1.  FIGURE: myocardial ischemia leads to interdigitations of
                non-ischemic regions

        ii. Scar tissue development becomes a nidus for VT/VF

            1.  Benefit of epicardial ablation at times

        iii. Adrenergic receptor dysregulation after ischemia

5.  Catecholamine-based necrosis

    a.  Malignant effects of catecholamines

        i.  Takotsubo to discuss apical ballooning

            1.  Mortality with Takotsubo is same with traditional AcS

        ii. Wellen’s T waves occur in setting of significant apical NE
            levels

            1.  Stress events

            2.  Cerebral injury

        iii. Effect of adrenergic receptor density on apex of the heart

    b.  Important neurotransmitters that mediate sympathetic tone

        i.  Sympathetic signals

            1.  NE

                a.  Alpha and beta adrenergic receptors have
                    differential preference of location

            2.  Galanin

            3.  NPY

        ii. Parasympathetic signals

            1.  Ach

            2.  NOS

        iii. TABLE: Describe individual neurohormones and effect on
            heart

    c.  Sympathetic dysregulation in heart failure

6.  Conclusion

    a.  Clinical importance of SNS

    b.  Innervation and sympathetic outflow is modulated

    c.  Has clinical effects on patients and leads to pathology
