 INTRODUCTION
=============

The human sympathetic nervous system, the master and commander of the
"fight or flight" response, has not adapted adequately to human disease.
It is the culprit in multiple pathological states, particularly that of
the heart. The sympathetic innervation of the heart is part of the
connection between the brain and the heart and it is inherent to
physiology and pathophysiology of cardiac autonomic function. The
purpose of this review article is to teach clinicians the importance of
the sympathetic nervous system in both normal and pathophysiological
states, share how pathology stems from inappropriate responses by the
autonomic nervous system, and to explore the anatomy and physiology of
sympathetic outflow to the heart. The reader should be able to (1)
understand the relevant anatomy of the sympathetic nervous system as it
innervates the heart, (2) understand the effects of sympathetic tone on
the heart, such as chronotropy, inotropy, lusitropy, and dromotropy, and
(3) understand how sympathetic dysfunction plays a role in pathological
states such as ventricular dysrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, and
cardiomyopathies.

ANATOMIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC CONSIDERATIONS
=======================================

Overview
--------

The neural control of the heart is in part a product of its anatomy. The
structure, sometimes described as the neurocardiac axis, has three
distinct levels: the brain and spinal cord, the thoracic and
extracardiac ganglia (EC), and the intrinsic cardiac nervous system
(IC).(Ardell & Armour, 2016) These levels send information through
afferent and efferent limbs of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems, and at each level interactions occur that affect the
autonomic state.

\[figure: innervation of the heart anatomy\]

Brain and spinal cord level
---------------------------

The spinal cord houses the preganglionic neurons of the SNS within the
lateral horns at each vertebral level. Cardiac outflow occurs between
the T1 and T6 vertebrae. The neurons exit through the ventral roots that
merge into the white rami, which join the sympathetic chain and the
ganglia of the EC. In contrast, the vagal preganglionic neurons are in
the brain stem, mainly the medullary dorsolateral reticular formation.
The thoracic spinal segments have a distinct cardiac rhythm and other
frequencies of oscillation that are transmitted to the postganglionic
neurons in the heart. The distinct periodicities include 10 Hz, 2-6 Hz,
respiratory rates, and slower firing that matches the speed of arterial
blood pressure oscillations (Mayer waves).(Malpas, 1998)

Although there is some automaticity of the firing rate of the SNS
neurons within the spinal cord, there are many higher orders of
influence that affect the activity of the preganglionic cell bodies. For
example, nervous activity such as a panic attack, can lead to increased
autonomic outflow, but so can events liked traumatic brain injury that
leads to hyperactivation and sympathetic storm. Other peripheral and
systemic reflexes are also integrated at the level of the spinal cord,
such as vasovagal syncope, the mesenteric ganglia response to stress
(lumbosacral outflow).

Thoracic, extracardiac level
----------------------------

The thoracic ganglia that make up the EC contain neurons that directly
innervate the myocardium. Both afferent and efferent pathways are
present. The most well-studied is of course the stellate ganglia, which
carries both preganglionic fibers and postganglionic neurons to the
heart. The right stellate ganglia (RSG) and the left stellate ganglia
(LSG) are seen to have differences in function based on the location of
their nerve endings. Of the ventricles, the RSG is directed towards the
anterior and basal aspects, while the LSG is directed towards the
posterior and apical aspects. Both ganglia however dually innervate the
anterior left ventricular (LV) wall.(Vaseghi et al., 2012) The RSG in
particular in addition has predominance in the atria, compared to the
LSG. The postganglionic fibers from the thoracic ganglia, as well as the
preganglionic fibers from the spinal cord, terminate within a complex
neural network of ganglionated plexuses (GPs) within the heart that
compose the IC.

Intrinsic cardiac level
-----------------------

The postganglionic neurons of the IC are found in the GPs, which are the
location for the interaction between preganglionic fibers,
parasympathetic fibers, and cardiac interneurons. The majority of GPs
contain 200-1000 neurons each, and form synapses with sympathetic and
parasympathetic fibers that enter the pericardial space.(J. Andrew
Armour, Murphy, Yuan, Macdonald, & Hopkins, 1997) The highest density of
GPs are near the hilum of the heart, with up to 50% of cardiac ganglia
on the dorsal surface of the LA.(Pauza, Skripka, Pauziene, & Stropus,
2000) Sympathetic nerves also travel along the major coronary arteries
as a plexus, and decrease in proportion to vessel size to 2 single
fibers at level of arterioles.(Dolezel, Gerová, Gero, Sládek, & Vasku,
1978)

The GPs extend epicardially to innervate the atria, interatrial septum,
and ventricles, but sympathetic innervation is not uniform. Early
studies looked at tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme that produces nor
epinephrine (NE), to help identify important sympathetic nerves and
fibers. The ventricles showed a gradient from base to apex, with the
lowest concentration in the apex of the heart.(Pierpont, DeMaster,
Reynolds, Pederson, & Cohn, 1985) Another way that the innervation has
been studied is by using radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a
catecholamine analog. Studies showed that the inferior wall of the LV
had less uptake than the anterior region. (Momose, Tyndale-Hines,
Bengel, & Schwaiger, 2001; Morozumi et al., 1997) In contrast, the
inferior LV wall has a higher proportion of vagal afferent
neurons.(Walker, Thames, Abboud, Mark, & Kloppenstein, 1978)

The layers of the heart also showed differences in sympathetic density.
The highest is in the epicardium, and it decreases reaching towards the
endocardium. Within the endocardium, there is a right-to-left decreasing
gradient of sympathetic innervation, proportional to the density of
cholinergic (vagal nerves).(Crick, Anderson, Ho, & Sheppard, 1999)
Within the epicardium, there is also ventricle-to-atrium decreasing
gradient of innervation. Within the ventricles, sympathetic afferent
neurons are the main sensory neurons. They are triggered by
predominately chemical stimuli, but also by mechanical stimuli.(J A
Armour, Huang, Pelleg, & Sylvén, 1994)

 VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATORY THRESHOLD
===================================

Over 100 years ago, John MacWilliam proposed that VF was the mechanism
behind SCD, and subsequently Thomas Jonnesco demonstrated that cardiac
sympathectomy was protective against ventricular arrhythmias.(de Silva,
1989; Peter J Schwartz, De Ferrari, & Pugliese, 2017) Other
corroborative studies by Bernard Lown showed that vagus nerve
stimulation decreased the vulnerability of the heart to VF while
vagotomy increased it.(Kolman, Verrier, & Lown, 1975; P. J. Schwartz,
Verrier, & Lown, 1977) This adequately argues that sympathetic tone is
in part culpable for VF/VT events.

\[figure of VF threshold and vagotomy\]

The unopposed sympathetic nerve is pathologic. Stimulation of the SNS
however can occur from higher nervous factors. An excellent example is
how the frequency of premature ventricular contractions increased under
psychological stress, suggesting that even transient nervous factors
lead to electrical instability.(Lown, Verrier, & Rabinowitz, 1977) These
extrasystole beats can be reduced by the introduction of beta-adrenergic
blockade.(Matta, Lawler, & Lown, 1976) Empiric and anecdotal evidence
provided the initial insight into how sudden death was triggered by
psychological stress. Engel described several categories of traumatic
life settings that precipitated sudden death, from the loss of a loved
one, acute grief, personal danger, and even triumph. This pattern was
found to play out in a larger scale, with case series by Greene and Rahe
that demonstrated hundreds of episodes of sudden death preceded acute
and chronic emotional events.(Greene, Goldstein, & Moss, 1972; Rahe,
Bennett, Romo, Siltanen, & Arthur, 1973)

\[figure: PVC frequency increased with stress\]

The evolutionary purpose of sympathetic outflow to the heart allows for
a by-product, the decrease in the VF threshold that is seen with
stellate stimulation . Its physiologic role however is related to the
original "fight or flight" response. Studies focused on the stellate
ganglia helped to delineate the specific actions the SNS had upon the
heart. The basic responses of the heart are inotropy (increased
"squeeze"), lusitropy (improved relaxation), chronotropy (increased
sinoatrial firing), and dromotropy (improved nerve conduction). There is
an element of handed-ness to the innervation, such that the right and
left stellate ganglia have differing effects, in part because of
location of innervation. The RSG has an higher amount of atrial
innervation, including the SA node, and leads to changes in chronotropy.
The LSG innervates the ventricles predominantly, leading to an increase
in inotropy. The relationship is complex, as right stellectomy can lead
to compensatory contralateral activation.(P. J. Schwartz et al., 1977)
Bilateral stellectomy though has a well-established effect of increased
the resilience of the heart to VT and VF.(Kliks, Burgess, & Abildskov,
1975)

 CORONARY PERFUSION
===================

In an out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, ST-segment elevations after VT or
VF event have over a 70% chance of significant coronary artery disease
(CAD).(Yannopoulos et al., 2019) Even after an MI, Dr. Bernard Lown
noted that patients were at significant risk for SCD and would benefit
from a coronary care unit that focused on prophylaxis of arrhythmias.
How do acute infarction and chronic ischemia generate malignant rhythms?
There are acute responses and delayed reorganization of the SNS that
explain these findings.

Knowledge of coronary blood flow regulation is important in
understanding the pathogenesis of VT and VF. The most prominent
regulators of the coronary arteries is based on pressure changes. High
pressure leads to sympathetic inhibition, while low pressures causes
increased sympathetic efferent outflow which leads to
vasoconstriction.(Drinkhill, Mcmahon, & Hainsworth, 1996; McMahon,
Drinkhill, & Hainsworth, 1996) The coronary arteries are innervated by
both adrenergic and cholinergic neurons, with an increase in the amount
of nerve terminals in the smaller arteries and arterioles.(Lever, Ahmed,
& Irvine, 1965) The beta-1 adrenergic receptors (B1AR) predominate the
larger conduit arteries while the smaller vessels have a higher
proportion of B2AR and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (A1AR).(Baumgart et
al., 1999; Murphree & Saffitz, 1988) For example, in cardiac transplant
patients, as they have no connection between the EC and IC, systemic NE
leads to coronary vasodilation in the large vessels (e.g. left anterior
descending) in proportion to the concentration of sympathetic nerve
terminals.(Di Carli et al., 2002) However, in the event of ischemia or
increased workflow, coronary vasoconstriction can be attenuated by the
metabolic waste productions like adenosine.(Abe, Morgan, & Gutterman,
1997) These differences in proportions of receptors are responsible for
balancing perfusion through local vasodilation and vasoconstriction in
the healthy heart, as a response to cardiac demand and myocardial
contraction. These systems were not built to respond to ischemia.

\[figure: coronary perfusion and VF threshold\]

The heart responds to acute changes in coronary perfusion with an
intense sympathetic response, which subsequently lowers the VF
threshold. Transmural infarcts lead to sympathetic denervation, while
subendocardial ischemia will likely only impact the vagal afferent nerve
endings.(Herre et al., 1988; Zipes, 1990) This was studied by looking at
the response of nerves to epicardial stimuli. Non-transmural ischemia
still allowed for a response to chemical stimuli, but transmural
ischemia lead to apical loss of efferent sympathetic nerves within 20
minutes. (Inoue, Skale, & Zipes, 1988) After 90 minutes, afferent
sympathetic and vagal nerves also became denervated.(Barber, Mueller,
Davies, Gill, & Zipes, 1985) During these ischemic events, there is an
increase in sympathetic excitatory outflow.(Minisi & Thames, 1991).

\[figure: zipes myocardial innervation\]

However there remains a prolonged risk for arrhythmias after
reperfusion. There is differential, heterogenous innervation of
sympathetic fibers in the cardiac tissue that become a nidus for
arrhythmogenesis. Initially after ischemia, IC neuronal remodeling
occurs. There is an immediate and persistent increase in nitric oxide
synthase (NOS) containing neurons and a hypersensitivity to NE stimuli
leading to generalized excitability.(Hardwick, Ryan, Beaumont, Ardell, &
Southerland, 2014) The non-ischemic and ischemic territories develop
differential sympathetic efferent activity after events as well.(Neely &
Hageman, 1990) Both denervation and hyperinnervation are the response,
and at the boundary of preserved and ischemic myocardium there becomes
an interdigitation of innervated and denervated tissue.(Huang, Boyle, &
Vaseghi, 2017) The nerve-sprouting that occurs is due to an increase in
activity of left stellate ganglia in the setting of chronic myocardial
ischemia.(Cao et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2001)

Not only does myocardial ischemia and infarction lead to changes in
innervation, but also in receptor density and response, which we will
discuss in the next section.

 EFFECT OF CATECHOLAMINES
=========================

The expected physiologic response to increased demands, through physical
or psychological arousal, is an augmented cardiac output upwards of 10
L/min mediated through local neurotransmitters. Myocardial contractility
is increased through the effect of NE on heavily
sympathetically-innervated myocardium, which leads to ventricular
inotropy and lusitropy through increased cytosolic calcium.(Shan et al.,
2010) The effect of NE at the SA and AV node leads to increases in
chronotropy (heart rate) and dromotropy (speed of conduction).(Franzoso,
Zaglia, & Mongillo, 2016; Liao, Lockhead, Larson, & Proenza, 2010)
However, at supraphysiologic levels, pathology develops.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, the "broken heart" syndrome, is a clinical
entity well-known for the role of SNS overactivity, characterized by
apical hypokinesis. Situations that cause sympathetic hyperactivation,
from elevated intracranial pressure, pheochromocytoma crises, and
emotionally devastating events, cause both increased systemic and
cardiac sympathetic outflow can lead to a stress
cardiomyopathy.(Krishnamoorthy, Burkhard Mackensen, Gibbons, & Vavilala,
2016; Y-Hassan & Tornvall, 2018) But is it systemic NE or local NE that
leads to these findings? There are two paths the sympathetic branch
takes to reach the apex of the heart -- through the coronary artery
system and direct innervation of the myocardium. Understanding the
location and density of adrenergic receptors helps to theorize how
catecholamine-excess states leads to cardiac pathology. Above, we
discussed the receptor locations within the coronary arteries, and here
we will discuss the importance of receptor location in the myocardium.

Almost all cardiomyocytes are in contact with sympathetic neurons, and
sympathetic stimulation leads to normal cardiomyocyte growth.(Franzoso
et al., 2016; Hirsch et al., 2013; Zaglia et al., 2013) B1AR and B2AR
are present in cardiac myocytes at sympathetic terminals. B1AR
accumulate at synapses, while B2AR undergo endocytosis after
stimulation.(Shcherbakova et al., 2007) These signals help regulate the
contractility of myocytes. The density of adrenergic receptors and NE is
predominant in the base of the heart, with lowest concentrations in the
apex.(Momose et al., 2001; Pierpont et al., 1985) Cardiac myocyte
toxicity occurs under excessive or prolonged catecholamine exposure, and
is seen in Takotsubo syndrome with contraction band necrosis on
histology.(Nef et al., 2007) The preference for the apex could be
through multivessel coronary vasospasm, however vessel A1AR and B1AR do
not lead to cardiomyocyte necrosis.(Y-Hassan, 2014) The apex may be more
vulnerable to NE overactivation due to the scarcity of available
adrenergic receptors, leading to relatively "earlier" saturation of
receptors compared to more proximal parts of the heart.

    iii. TABLE: Describe individual neurohormones and effect on heart

Although NE is the typical mediator of adrenergic fibers, the other
relevant neurohormones have an important role in their interactions.
Through immunofluorescent staining, multiple neuronal somata have been
identified. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) produced acetylcholine
(ACh), which are typically cardioinhibitory. Cholinergic cell bodies
predominate cardiac nerves, making anywhere from 60% to 100% of cardiac
ganglia. ChAT somata are also more common in the atria than the rest of
the heart. In the presence of NE, the inhibitory effects of ACh are
exaggerated in a phenomenon called accentuated antagonism.(Levy, 1971;
Stramba-Badiale et al., 1991) Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) produces
nitric oxide (NO), and colocalizes with ChAT somata. Its present equally
from endocardium to epicardium, but the density favors the base versus
the apex.(Brack, Patel, Coote, & Ng, 2007) As it is also a
co-transmitter that modulates the vagal effect of increasing the VF
threshold, through modifying action potential duration (APD). Vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP) is also co-released with ACh, however neuronal
somata containing VIP are scarce within the IC. All of the nerve fibers
reaching into the cardiac ganglia however are reactive for VIP which
likely comes from central sources.(Hoover et al., 2009; Parsons,
Locknar, Young, Hoard, & Hoover, 2006)

TH is responsible for NE production, but surprisingly 10-20% of all
neurons contain both TH and ChAT.(Pauza et al., 2013) Both the left and
right coronary plexuses however are mainly adrenergic.(Pauziene et al.,
2016) Alongside NE, neuropeptide Y (NPY) is co-released. At the level of
the synapse, NPY attenuates the effect of vagal tone by decreasing ACh
release.(Herring, Lokale, Danson, Heaton, & Paterson, 2008) It also
functions as a potent coronary vasoconstrictor acutely, however may lead
to angiogenesis in the long-term.(Herring, 2015) NPY, in human studies,
leads to mild constriction of epicardial arteries for all patients.
However, in those with microvascular angina, defined by normal left
heart catherization but abnormal myocardial perfusion, NPY leads to
transient myocardial ischemia.(Rosano et al., 2017) Galanin is also
released alongside NPY, and it acts by inhibiting cholinergic nerves to
reduce ACh release. Galanin receptors (GalR1) are found on ChAT somata
and synapses, and may mediate the breaking of vagal bradycardia as it is
expressed strongly at the sinoatrial (SA) node.(Herring et al., 2012)
Galanin is normally only co-expressed in \~5% of TH somata in the
stellate, however after injury, its levels are increased to almost all
neurons within 72 hours.(Herring et al., 2012)

Cardiomyopathy
--------------

1.  Increased sympathetic tone in ischemic HF models (porcine) improves
    myocardial contraction, decreased oxygen consumption, decreases
    intraventricular desynchrony, all without elevation of NE. (Liu et
    al., 2012)

2.  After developing late-stage HF, neuronal bodies become hypertrophied
    and edematous. They become less excitable and may lead to vagal
    withdrawal. (Singh et al., 2013)

3.  In both ischemic and dilated CM...B1 receptor downregulation
    (proportion of subtypes are the same compared to healthy).
    Transmural distribution is different, c- lower B1 receptors found in
    subendocardium. (Beau, Tolley, & Saffitz, 1993)

4.  Cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) causes minimal increase
    in contractility, but has increased peripheral vasoconstriction
    (compared to rat controls). CSAR can be inhibited by epicardial
    lidocaine -- decreased contractility more in HF rats than control
    (also caused drop in LVEDP paradoxically). (Wang, Rozanski, &
    Zucker, 2017)
