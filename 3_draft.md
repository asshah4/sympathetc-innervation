 INTRODUCTION
=============

The human sympathetic nervous system, the master and commander of the
"fight or flight" response, has not adapted adequately to human disease.
It is the culprit in multiple pathological states, particularly that of
the heart. The sympathetic innervation of the heart is part of the
connection between the brain and the heart and it is inherent to
physiology and pathophysiology of cardiac autonomic function. The
purpose of this review article is to teach clinicians the importance of
the sympathetic nervous system in both normal and pathophysiological
states, share how pathology stems from inappropriate responses by the
autonomic nervous system, and to explore the anatomy and physiology of
sympathetic outflow to the heart. The reader should be able to (1)
understand the relevant anatomy of the sympathetic nervous system as it
innervates the heart, (2) understand the effects of sympathetic tone on
the heart, such as chronotropy, inotropy, lusitropy, and dromotropy, and
(3) understand how sympathetic dysfunction plays a role in pathological
states such as ventricular dysrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, and
cardiomyopathies.

ANATOMIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC CONSIDERATIONS
=======================================

Overview
--------

The neural control of the heart is in part a product of its anatomy. The
structure, sometimes described as the neurocardiac axis, has three
distinct levels: the brain and spinal cord, the thoracic and
extracardiac ganglia (EC), and the intrinsic cardiac nervous system
(IC).^1^ These levels send information through afferent and efferent
limbs of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and
at each level interactions occur that affect the autonomic state.

Brain and spinal cord level
---------------------------

The spinal cord houses the preganglionic neurons of the SNS within the
lateral horns at each vertebral level. Cardiac outflow occurs between
the T1 and T6 vertebrae. The neurons exit through the ventral roots that
merge into the white rami, which join the sympathetic chain and the
ganglia of the EC. In contrast, the vagal preganglionic neurons are in
the brain stem, mainly the medullary dorsolateral reticular formation.
The thoracic spinal segments have a distinct cardiac rhythm and other
frequencies of oscillation that are transmitted to the postganglionic
neurons in the heart. The distinct periodicities include 10 Hz, 2-6 Hz,
respiratory rates, and slower firing that matches the speed of arterial
blood pressure oscillations (Mayer waves).^2^

Although there is some automaticity of the firing rate of the SNS
neurons within the spinal cord, there are many higher orders of
influence that affect the activity of the preganglionic cell bodies. For
example, nervous activity such as a panic attack, can lead to increased
autonomic outflow, but so can events liked traumatic brain injury that
leads to hyperactivation and sympathetic storm. Other peripheral and
systemic reflexes are also integrated at the level of the spinal cord,
such as vasovagal syncope, the mesenteric ganglia response to stress
(lumbosacral outflow).

Thoracic, extracardiac level
----------------------------

The thoracic ganglia that make up the EC contain neurons that directly
innervate the myocardium. Both afferent and efferent pathways are
present. The most well-studied is of course the stellate ganglia, which
carries both preganglionic fibers and postganglionic neurons to the
heart. The right stellate ganglia (RSG) and the left stellate ganglia
(LSG) are seen to have differences in function based on the location of
their nerve endings. Of the ventricles, the RSG is directed towards the
anterior and basal aspects, while the LSG is directed towards the
posterior and apical aspects. Both ganglia however dually innervate the
anterior left ventricular (LV) wall.^3^ The RSG in particular in
addition has predominance in the atria, compared to the LSG. The
postganglionic fibers from the thoracic ganglia, as well as the
preganglionic fibers from the spinal cord, terminate within a complex
neural network of ganglionated plexuses (GPs) within the heart that
compose the IC.

Intrinsic cardiac level
-----------------------

The postganglionic neurons of the IC are found in the GPs, which are the
location for the interaction between preganglionic fibers,
parasympathetic fibers, and cardiac interneurons. The majority of GPs
contain 200-1000 neurons each, and form synapses with sympathetic and
parasympathetic fibers that enter the pericardial space.^4^ The highest
density of GPs are near the hilum of the heart, with up to 50% of
cardiac ganglia on the dorsal surface of the LA.^5^ Sympathetic nerves
also travel along the major coronary arteries as a plexus, and decrease
in proportion to vessel size to 2 single fibers at level of
arterioles.^6^

The GPs extend epicardially to innervate the atria, interatrial septum,
and ventricles, but sympathetic innervation is not uniform. Early
studies looked at tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme that produces nor
epinephrine (NE), to help identify important sympathetic nerves and
fibers. The ventricles showed a gradient from base to apex, with the
lowest concentration in the apex of the heart.^7^ Another way that the
innervation has been studied is by using radiolabeled
metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a catecholamine analog. Studies showed
that the inferior wall of the LV had less uptake than the anterior
region. ^8,9^ In contrast, the inferior LV wall has a higher proportion
of vagal afferent neurons.^10^

The layers of the heart also showed differences in sympathetic density.
The highest is in the epicardium, and it decreases reaching towards the
endocardium. Within the endocardium, there is a right-to-left decreasing
gradient of sympathetic innervation, proportional to the density of
cholinergic (vagal nerves).^11^ Within the epicardium, there is also
ventricle-to-atrium decreasing gradient of innervation. Within the
ventricles, sympathetic afferent neurons are the main sensory neurons.
They are triggered by predominately chemical stimuli, but also by
mechanical stimuli.^12^

 VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATORY THRESHOLD
===================================

1.  Ventricular fibrillatory threshold

    a.  Pertinent history of SCD

        i.  SCD occurs with increased sympathetic tone

            1.  Historical studies about emotional and stress triggers

        ii. Lown et al showed increased SNS leads to VT/VF in humans

        iii. Increased PVC during times of stress and increased SNS
            activity in human recordings

        iv. VF threshold is modulated by different factors (mainly SNS
            activity)

            2.  Increased likelihood of ventricular dysrhythmias of the
                heart

    b.  Normal effects of sympathetic tone through stellate ganglia
        stimulation

        v.  Increased SNS (e.g. stellate stimulation) leads to increased
            inotropy/lusitropy

        vi. RSG stimulation leads to increased SA firing, thus increased
            chronotropy/dromotropy

        vii. Increased stimulation leads to increased episodes of VT/VF
            (excluding effects of ischemia)

        <!-- -->

        i.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF)

            1.  pAF induced by initial adrenergic surge, followed by
                vagal predominance. ^13,14^ Mediated by increased PV
                firing from tachycardia-pause initiations which lead to
                increased EAD. ^15^

            2.  Extrinsic cardiac (EC) after

        ii. VT/VF

            3.  Stimulation of the stellate ganglion in canine models
                had increased chance of causing ventricular fibrillation
                particularly after coronary occlusion.^16^ Stellate
                ganglion thought to be carrying efferent sympathetic
                fibers. After stellate ganglionectomy, the VF threshold
                increased to 11% from 31% (compared to control VF rate).
                ^17^ Unilateral stellectomy may have compensatory
                contralateral activation, and then are agonized by vagal
                activity.^18^

        iii. Long QT syndromes

            1.  Increased beta-agonism leads to torsades de pointe (Tdp)
                d/t increased dispersion of depolarization or
                afterdepolarizations. ^19^

 CORONARY PERFUSION
===================

Coronary perfusion
------------------

a.  Coronary perfusion

    iv. Coronary baroreceptor

        4.  Baroreceptor reflex vagally mediated: high coronary pressure
            leads to sympathetic inhibition, but low pressures lead to
            delayed/slow efferent sympathetic outflow/vasoconstriction.
            ^20,21^

    v.  Coronary blood flow

        5.  Sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction can be
            attenuated/blocked by adenosine. ^22^

        6.  Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased coronary
            vasodilation based on NE content of sympathetic nerve
            terminals (LAD \> LCx \> RCA), but only in cardiac
            transplant patients. ^23^ Suggest EC influences on IC may
            exist.

        7.  Innervated by both adrenergic and cholinergic neurons.
            Smaller arteries/arterioles contain more nerve terminals
            than larger coronary arteries. ^24^

        8.  B1AR predominantly in larger coronary conduit arteries
            (B1AR:B2AR in \~2:1 ratio) \> 100 µm, while in smaller
            coronary arteries \< 100 µm, B1AR \~= B2AR. ^25^ B1AR
            stimulation leads to vasodilation, while A1AR leads to
            vasoconstriction. ^26^ May exist to limit large vessel
            "steal" during ischemia.

Myocardial infarction and ischemia
----------------------------------

Coronary perfusion

c.  Myocardial infarction/ischemia

    viii. Advent of MI can change and increase VT/VF events

    ix. Infarction leads to rewiring of the heart, including NE release

    x.  Beta blockers, CCU "quiet and calm" can prevent sympathetic
        dysregulation

d.  Cardiac innervation heterogeneity

    xi. Localized changes occur after infarct, included denervation

        3.  FIGURE: myocardial ischemia leads to interdigitations of
            non-ischemic regions

    xii. Scar tissue development becomes a nidus for VT/VF

        4.  Benefit of epicardial ablation at times

    xiii. Adrenergic receptor dysregulation after ischemia

<!-- -->

1.  Ventricular wall

    a.  Transmural infarct leads to sympathetic denervation
        (subendocardial ischemia may only damage vagal afferent).
        ^27,28^ Afferent sympathetic/vagal denervation occurs within 90
        minutes after infarct at site, which travel apical-to-basal.
        ^29^ Non-transmural ischemia retains response to stimuli. ^30^
        Transmural ischemia leads to apical loss of efferent sympathetic
        nerves within 20 minutes. ^31^

    b.  Areas of cardiac tissue that have lost sympathetic innervation
        have supersensitive shortening of ERP to stimuli (e.g. NE or
        cervical ganglia stimulation), and have increased VF events.
        ^32^

    c.  Sympathetic efferent show different activity based on
        innervating ischemic vs non-ischemic territory. ^33^

    d.  Transmural ischemia, hitting epicardial layer (without
        collaterals like in dogs), triggers sympathetic afferent
        activity = leads to excitatory outflow. ^34^. Left ventricular
        wall has asymmetric sympathovagal innervation: vagal afferent
        preferentially distribute to inferior-posterior LV wall,
        sympathetic afferent are equally distributed (tested by inducing
        ischemia). ^35^

    e.  Ischemia leads to IC neuronal remodeling, with
        immediate/persistent increase in NOS-neurons, with
        hypersensitivity to NE stimuli (increase GP excitability,
        augmented post-MI). ^36^

    f.  Response to ischemia can be denervation vs. hyperinnervation,
        leads to heterogenous sympathetic fibers (increased
        arrhythmogenesis). ^37^ Nerve sprouting theory: increased
        sympathetic neurons lead to increased VT/VF in ischemia (induced
        by nerve growth factor in LSG), and in chronic myocardial
        ischemia, higher amount of LSG sympathetic nerve sprouting
        occurs. ^38,39^

 EFFECT OF CATECHOLAMINES

            5.  Mortality with Takotsubo is same with traditional AcS

            levels

            6.  Stress events

            7.  Cerebral injury

        xvi. Effect of adrenergic receptor density on apex of the heart

Neurotransmitters
-----------------

f.  Important neurotransmitters that mediate sympathetic tone

    xvii. Sympathetic signals

        8.  NE

            a.  Alpha and beta adrenergic receptors have differential
                preference of location

        9.  Galanin

        10. NPY

    xviii.  Parasympathetic signals

        11. Ach

        12. NOS

    xix. TABLE: Describe individual neurohormones and effect on heart

Although NE is the typical mediator of adrenergic fibers, the other
relevant neurohormones have an important role in their interactions.
Through immunofluorescent staining, multiple neuronal somata have been
identified. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) produced acetylcholine
(ACh), which are typically cardioinhibitory. Cholinergic cell bodies
predominate cardiac nerves, making anywhere from 60% to 100% of cardiac
ganglia. ChAT somata are also more common in the atria than the rest of
the heart. In the presence of NE, the inhibitory effects of ACh are
exaggerated in a phenomenon called accentuated antagonism.^40,41^ Nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), and colocalizes with
ChAT somata. Its present equally from endocardium to epicardium, but the
density favors the base versus the apex.^42^ As it is also a
co-transmitter that modulates the vagal effect of increasing the VF
threshold, through modifying action potential duration (APD). Vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP) is also co-released with ACh, however neuronal
somata containing VIP are scarce within the IC. All of the nerve fibers
reaching into the cardiac ganglia however are reactive for VIP which
likely comes from central sources.^43,44^

TH is responsible for NE production, but surprisingly 10-20% of all
neurons contain both TH and ChAT.^45^ Both the left and right coronary
plexuses however are mainly adrenergic.^46^ Alongside NE, neuropeptide Y
(NPY) is co-released. At the level of the synapse, NPY attenuates the
effect of vagal tone by decreasing ACh release.^47^ It also functions as
a potent coronary vasoconstrictor acutely, however may lead to
angiogenesis in the long-term.^48^ NPY, in human studies, leads to mild
constriction of epicardial arteries for all patients. However, in those
with microvascular angina, defined by normal left heart catherization
but abnormal myocardial perfusion, NPY leads to transient myocardial
ischemia.^49^ Galanin is also released alongside NPY, and it acts by
inhibiting cholinergic nerves to reduce ACh release. Galanin receptors
(GalR1) are found on ChAT somata and synapses, and may mediate the
breaking of vagal bradycardia as it is expressed strongly at the
sinoatrial (SA) node.^50^ Galanin is normally only co-expressed in \~5%
of TH somata in the stellate, however after injury, its levels are
increased to almost all neurons within 72 hours.^50^

The direct effect of sympathetic firing is through the release of NE,
which can bind to four different adrenergic receptors (AR). B1 and B2
adrenergic recept

vi. B1 and B2 adrenergic receptors are present in cardiac myocytes at
    sympathetic synaptic terminals; B1AR accumulate at synapses, while
    B2AR undergo endocytosis/internalization. ^51^ Beta-agonists lead to
    increase in cardiac mass through increased size of cardiac myocytes.
    ^52,53^

vii. Almost all cardiomyocytes are in contact with sympathetic neurons
    (similar proportion to contact c- capillaries). ^54^ Basal/trophic
    sympathetic release leads to cardiomyocyte eutrophy (loss of
    beta-agonism leads to atrophy).

Cardiomyopathy
--------------

2.  Increased sympathetic tone in ischemic HF models (porcine) improves
    myocardial contraction, decreased oxygen consumption, decreases
    intraventricular desynchrony, all without elevation of NE. ^55^

3.  After developing late-stage HF, neuronal bodies become hypertrophied
    and edematous. They become less excitable and may lead to vagal
    withdrawal. ^56^

4.  In both ischemic and dilated CM...B1 receptor downregulation
    (proportion of subtypes are the same compared to healthy).
    Transmural distribution is different, c- lower B1 receptors found in
    subendocardium. ^57^

5.  Cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) causes minimal increase
    in contractility, but has increased peripheral vasoconstriction
    (compared to rat controls). CSAR can be inhibited by epicardial
    lidocaine -- decreased contractility more in HF rats than control
    (also caused drop in LVEDP paradoxically). ^58^

    g.  Myocardial contractility

        viii. NE release by the heavily sympathetically-innervated
            myocardium leads to Ca++ channel activity and ryanodine
            receptor (RyR), which leads to increased cytosolic Ca++.
            Effect is increased inotropy/lusitropy. ^59^ Sympathetic
            stimuli with NE at SA node also leads to increased
            myocardial interstitial levels of NE, which lead to
            ventricular inotropy.

<!-- -->

a.  Electrical conduction

    ix. Chronotropy/dromotropy

        9.  SA node firing rate depends on "funny current", which has
            inward-rectifying Na+ current that leads to depolarization
            through the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic
            nucleotide-gated channel (HCN). Sympathetic tone leads to
            dromotropy/chronotropy through increased HCN activity,
            spontaneous SA depolarization rate, and sarcoplasmic
            reticulum release of Ca++, as well increased depolarization
            through other neuronal bundles (e.g. His bundle, AV node,
            etc). ^52,60^

    x.  Repolarization

        10. Effective refractory period (ERP) are shorted by sympathetic
            excitation, while sympathetic inhibition prolongs ERP...
            similar in endocardium/epicardium. ^61^ Transmural
            dispersion of repolarization also shortened by sympathetic
            activity, prolonged by beta-blockade. ^62^
