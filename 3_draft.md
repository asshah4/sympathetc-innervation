1.  Introduction

    a.  Background

        i.  Neurocardiac axis mediates connection between brain and
            heart

    b.  Purpose

        ii. Teach clinicians that sympathetic nervous system is
            important in normal function as well as pathophysiologic
            states

        iii. Share how the heart and autonomic system was not built to
            respond to

        iv. Explore the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology
            relevance of sympathetic outflow to the heart

    c.  Objectives

        v.  Understand how the sympathetic nervous system innervates the
            heart

        vi. Understand how sympathetic tone effects the functions of the
            heart (such as chronotropy, inotropy, lusitropy, dromotropy)

        vii. Review how sympathetic dysfunction occurs in pathological
            states, such as VT/VF, MI, and stress cardiomyopathy.

The human sympathetic nervous system, the master and commander of the
"fight or flight" response, has not adapted adequately to human disease.
It is the culprit in multiple pathological states, particularly that of
the heart. The sympathetic innervation of the heart is part of the
connection between the brain and the heart, and is inherent in
physiology and pathophysiology of cardiac autonomic function. The
purpose of this review article is to teach clinicians the importance of
the sympathetic nervous system in both normal and pathophysiological
states, share how pathology stems from inappropriate responses by the
autonomic nervous system, and to explore the anatomy and physiology of
sympathetic outflow to the heart. The reader should be able to (1)
understand how the sympathetic nervous system innervates the heart, (2)
understand the effects of sympathetic tone on the heart, such s
chronotropy, inotropy, lusitropy, and dromotropy, and (3) understand
sympathetic dysfunction in described pathological states such as
ventricular dysrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, and cardiomyopathies.

ANATOMIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC CONSIDERATIONS
=======================================

Overview
--------

The neural control of the heart is in part a product of its anatomy. The
structure, sometimes described as the neurocardiac axis, has three
distinct levels: the brain and spinal cord, the thoracic and
extracardiac ganglia (EC), and the intrinsic cardiac nervous system
(IC).^1^ These levels send information through afferent and efferent
limbs of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and
at each level interactions occur that affect the autonomic state.

Brain and spinal cord level
---------------------------

a.  Spinal cord level

    viii. Spinal cord anatomy of preganglionic neurons location, and
        both proximal and distal connections to brain and postganglionic
        neurons

        1.  Automaticity and firing of these SNS neurons

    ix. Effect of cerebral/nervous influences on these preganglionic
        cell bodies

        2.  Examples include sympathetic storm from TBI, which leads to
            hyperactivation

        3.  Nervous activity (e.g. panic attack) on the preganglionic
            bodies (what is the connection/mechanism of communicatin)

    x.  Integration of systemic/peripheral reflex arcs into the spinal
        cord

        4.  Examples include vasovagal syncope, mesenteric ganglia
            response to stress, etc (lumbosacral outflow)

Thoracic, extracardiac level
----------------------------

a.  Thoracic, extracardiac level

    xi. Anatomy of the thoracic ganglia

        5.  Preganglionic fibers exit from DRG and enter white rami,
            then eventually form sympathetic chain and thoracic ganglia

        6.  T1 to T6 specifically are responsible for cardiac outflow

    xii. Stellate ganglia

        7.  Historic examples include stellectomy/ganglion block to help
            decrease VT/VF burden

        8.  Innervation of the heart is different between LSG and RSG,
            to some degree

The preganglionic neurons are rooted in the lateral horns of the spinal
cord, and the cardiac outflow occurs between the T1 and T6 vertebrae.
After exiting the spinal cord from the ventral roots into the white
rami, they join the sympathetic chain, which form the ganglia of the EC.
In contrast, the vagal preganglionic neurons are found in the brain
stem, mainly in the medullary dorsolateral reticular formation. The
thoracic spinal segments have a distinct cardiac rhythm and other
oscillatory frequencies that are reproduced at the level of cardiac
postganglionic neurons. They have periodicities from 2-6 Hz, 10 Hz,
respiratory rates, and slower oscillations (\~0.3 Hz) that match the
speed of arterial blood pressure oscillations named Mayer waves.^2^

The myocardium is innervated directly by these sympathetic neurons, with
both afferent and efferent pathways present. The stellate ganglia are
perhaps the most well-studied, carrying both preganglionic fibers and
postganglionic neurons to the heart. The right stellate ganglia (RSG)
and the left stellate ganglia (LSG) are seen to have differences in
function based on the location of their nerve endings. Of the
ventricles, the RSG is directed towards the anterior and basal aspects,
while the LSG is directed towards the posterior and apical aspects. Both
ganglia however dually innervate the anterior left ventricular (LV)
wall.^3^ The RSG in particular in addition has predominance in the
atria, compared to the LSG. The postganglionic fibers from the thoracic
ganglia, as well as the preganglionic fibers from the spinal cord,
terminate within a complex neural network of ganglionated plexuses (GPs)
within the heart that compose the IC.

Intrinsic cardiac level
-----------------------

a.  Intrinsic cardiac level

    xiii. Sympathetic nervous system is within GPs around epicardium of
        heart, particularly in epicardial fat pads.

    xiv. Innervation of the cardiac chambers and wall

        9.  Epicardium is highest density of nerve fibers, which
            decrease as going into endocardium

        10. Atria have different right-to-left innervation of both
            adrenergic and cholinergic nerves

        11. Ventricles have a base-to-apex density gradient of
            adrenergic fibers, but barely any vagal fibers (except
            inferior wall)

    xv. Coronary artery innervation goes from a plexus around
        major/large arteries, and decreases in size until it is only 1-2
        nerves at level of arteriole

The postganglionic neurons of the IC are found in the GPs, which are the
location for the interaction between preganglionic fibers,
parasympathetic fibers, and cardiac interneurons. The majority of GPs
contain 200-1000 neurons each, and form synapses with sympathetic and
parasympathetic fibers that enter the pericardial space.^4^ The GPs
themselves are mainly found in epicardial and hilar fat pads in a
consistent pattern within humans.^5^ The right atrium (RA) is innervated
by two GPs, the left atrium (LA) by three, the right ventricle (RV) by
one, the left ventricle (LV) by three. The highest density of GPs are
near the hilum of the heart, with up to 50% of cardiac ganglia on the
dorsal surface of the LA.^6^ The GPs extend epicardially to innervate
the atria, interatrial septum, and ventricles. Three GPs and subplexuses
innervate the pulmonary veins, with about 2000 neurons residing at the
base of each vein.^7^ Sympathetic nerves also travel along the major
coronary arteries as a plexus, and decrease in proportion to vessel size
to 2 single fibers at level of arterioles.^8^

Adrenergic fibers are seen in all four chambers and layers of the heart,
but sympathetic innervation is not uniform. In initial studies, the
enzyme responsible for nor epinephrine (NE) production, tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH), was stained to identify sympathetic somata and fibers.
The ventricles themselves show a gradient from base to apex, with the
highest NE concentration in the apex.^9^ Using radiolabeled
metaiodobenzylguanidine, a catecholamine analog, its seen that the
inferior wall of the LV has less uptake than the anterior region.^10,11^
In contrast, the inferior wall of the LV has a higher proportion of
vagal afferent neurons.^12^ The RA itself shows only a small
subpopulation of adrenergic fibers. This was determined by GP epicardial
fat biopsy during cardiothoracic surgery, with immunofluorescent
staining showing a majority population of parasympathetic markers.^13^
The highest density is found in the epicardium, decreasing towards the
endocardium. Within the endocardium, adrenergic nerves found in the
atrium show an right-to-left decreasing gradient, which mimics the
density of cholinergic (vagal) nerves.^14^ Within the epicardium, there
is also ventricle-to-atrium decreasing gradient of innervation. Within
the ventricles, sympathetic afferent neurons are main sensory neurons.
They are triggered by predominately chemical stimuli, but also by
mechanical stimuli.^15^

 VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATORY THRESHOLD
===================================

2.  Ventricular fibrillatory threshold

    d.  Pertinent history of SCD

        xvi. SCD occurs with increased sympathetic tone

            12. Historical studies about emotional and stress triggers

        xvii. Lown et al showed increased SNS leads to VT/VF in humans

        xviii.  Increased PVC during times of stress and increased SNS
            activity in human recordings

        xix. VF threshold is modulated by different factors (mainly SNS
            activity)

            13. Increased likelihood of ventricular dysrhythmias of the
                heart

    e.  Normal effects of sympathetic tone through stellate ganglia
        stimulation

        xx. Increased SNS (e.g. stellate stimulation) leads to increased
            inotropy/lusitropy

        xxi. RSG stimulation leads to increased SA firing, thus
            increased chronotropy/dromotropy

        xxii. Increased stimulation leads to increased episodes of VT/VF
            (excluding effects of ischemia)

        <!-- -->

        i.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF)

            1.  pAF induced by initial adrenergic surge, followed by
                vagal predominance. (Bettoni & Zimmermann, 2002; Tomita
                et al., 2003) Mediated by increased PV firing from
                tachycardia-pause initiations which lead to increased
                EAD. (Patterson et al., 2007)

            2.  Extrinsic cardiac (EC) after

        ii. VT/VF

            3.  Stimulation of the stellate ganglion in canine models
                had increased chance of causing ventricular fibrillation
                particularly after coronary occlusion.(Harris, Otero, &
                Bocage, 1971) Stellate ganglion thought to be carrying
                efferent sympathetic fibers. After stellate
                ganglionectomy, the VF threshold increased to 11% from
                31% (compared to control VF rate). (Kliks, Burgess, &
                Abildskov, 1975) Unilateral stellectomy may have
                compensatory contralateral activation, and then are
                agonized by vagal activity.(Schwartz, Verrier, &
                Lown, 1977)

        iii. Long QT syndromes

            1.  Increased beta-agonism leads to torsades de pointe (Tdp)
                d/t increased dispersion of depolarization or
                afterdepolarizations. (Shimizu & Antzelevitch, 1998)

 CORONARY PERFUSION
===================

Coronary perfusion
------------------

a.  Coronary perfusion

    iv. Coronary baroreceptor

        4.  Baroreceptor reflex vagally mediated: high coronary pressure
            leads to sympathetic inhibition, but low pressures lead to
            delayed/slow efferent sympathetic outflow/vasoconstriction.
            (Drinkhill, Mcmahon, & Hainsworth, 1996; McMahon, Drinkhill,
            & Hainsworth, 1996)

    v.  Coronary blood flow

        5.  Sympathetic coronary vasoconstriction can be
            attenuated/blocked by adenosine. (Abe, Morgan, &
            Gutterman, 1997)

        6.  Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased coronary
            vasodilation based on NE content of sympathetic nerve
            terminals (LAD \> LCx \> RCA), but only in cardiac
            transplant patients. (Di Carli et al., 2002) Suggest EC
            influences on IC may exist.

        7.  Innervated by both adrenergic and cholinergic neurons.
            Smaller arteries/arterioles contain more nerve terminals
            than larger coronary arteries. (Lever, Ahmed, &
            Irvine, 1965)

        8.  B1AR predominantly in larger coronary conduit arteries
            (B1AR:B2AR in \~2:1 ratio) \> 100 µm, while in smaller
            coronary arteries \< 100 µm, B1AR \~= B2AR. (Murphree &
            Saffitz, 1988) B1AR stimulation leads to vasodilation, while
            A1AR leads to vasoconstriction. (Baumgart et al., 1999) May
            exist to limit large vessel "steal" during ischemia.

Myocardial infarction and ischemia
----------------------------------

Coronary perfusion

f.  Myocardial infarction/ischemia

    xxiii.  Advent of MI can change and increase VT/VF events

    xxiv. Infarction leads to rewiring of the heart, including NE
        release

    xxv. Beta blockers, CCU "quiet and calm" can prevent sympathetic
        dysregulation

g.  Cardiac innervation heterogeneity

    xxvi. Localized changes occur after infarct, included denervation

        14. FIGURE: myocardial ischemia leads to interdigitations of
            non-ischemic regions

    xxvii.  Scar tissue development becomes a nidus for VT/VF

        15. Benefit of epicardial ablation at times

    xxviii.   Adrenergic receptor dysregulation after ischemia

<!-- -->

1.  Ventricular wall

    a.  Transmural infarct leads to sympathetic denervation
        (subendocardial ischemia may only damage vagal afferent). (Herre
        et al., 1988; Zipes, 1990) Afferent sympathetic/vagal
        denervation occurs within 90 minutes after infarct at site,
        which travel apical-to-basal. (Barber, Mueller, Davies, Gill, &
        Zipes, 1985) Non-transmural ischemia retains response to
        stimuli. (Inoue, Skale, & Zipes, 1988) Transmural ischemia leads
        to apical loss of efferent sympathetic nerves within 20 minutes.
        (Inoue & Zipes, 1988)

    b.  Areas of cardiac tissue that have lost sympathetic innervation
        have supersensitive shortening of ERP to stimuli (e.g. NE or
        cervical ganglia stimulation), and have increased VF events.
        (Inoue & Zipes, 1987)

    c.  Sympathetic efferent show different activity based on
        innervating ischemic vs non-ischemic territory. (Neely &
        Hageman, 1990)

    d.  Transmural ischemia, hitting epicardial layer (without
        collaterals like in dogs), triggers sympathetic afferent
        activity = leads to excitatory outflow. (Anthony J Minisi &
        Thames, 1991). Left ventricular wall has asymmetric
        sympathovagal innervation: vagal afferent preferentially
        distribute to inferior-posterior LV wall, sympathetic afferent
        are equally distributed (tested by inducing ischemia). (A J
        Minisi & Thames, 1993)

    e.  Ischemia leads to IC neuronal remodeling, with
        immediate/persistent increase in NOS-neurons, with
        hypersensitivity to NE stimuli (increase GP excitability,
        augmented post-MI). (Hardwick, Ryan, Beaumont, Ardell, &
        Southerland, 2014)

    f.  Response to ischemia can be denervation vs. hyperinnervation,
        leads to heterogenous sympathetic fibers (increased
        arrhythmogenesis). (Huang, Boyle, & Vaseghi, 2017) Nerve
        sprouting theory: increased sympathetic neurons lead to
        increased VT/VF in ischemia (induced by nerve growth factor in
        LSG), and in chronic myocardial ischemia, higher amount of LSG
        sympathetic nerve sprouting occurs. (Cao et al., 2000; Chen et
        al., 2001)

    xxxiv.  TABLE: Describe individual neurohormones and effect on heart

Although NE is the typical mediator of adrenergic fibers, the other
relevant neurohormones have an important role in their interactions.
Through immunofluorescent staining, multiple neuronal somata have been
identified. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) produced acetylcholine
(ACh), which are typically cardioinhibitory. Cholinergic cell bodies
predominate cardiac nerves, making anywhere from 60% to 100% of cardiac
ganglia. ChAT somata are also more common in the atria than the rest of
the heart. In the presence of NE, the inhibitory effects of ACh are
exaggerated in a phenomenon called accentuated antagonism.^16,17^ Nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), and colocalizes with
ChAT somata. Its present equally from endocardium to epicardium, but the
density favors the base versus the apex.^18^ As it is also a
co-transmitter that modulates the vagal effect of increasing the VF
threshold, through modifying action potential duration (APD). Vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP) is also co-released with ACh, however neuronal
somata containing VIP are scarce within the IC. All of the nerve fibers
reaching into the cardiac ganglia however are reactive for VIP which
likely comes from central sources.^13,19^

TH is responsible for NE production, but surprisingly 10-20% of all
neurons contain both TH and ChAT.^20^ Both the left and right coronary
plexuses however are mainly adrenergic.^21^ Alongside NE, neuropeptide Y
(NPY) is co-released. At the level of the synapse, NPY attenuates the
effect of vagal tone by decreasing ACh release.^22^ It also functions as
a potent coronary vasoconstrictor acutely, however may lead to
angiogenesis in the long-term.^23^ NPY, in human studies, leads to mild
constriction of epicardial arteries for all patients. However, in those
with microvascular angina, defined by normal left heart catherization
but abnormal myocardial perfusion, NPY leads to transient myocardial
ischemia.^24^ Galanin is also released alongside NPY, and it acts by
inhibiting cholinergic nerves to reduce ACh release. Galanin receptors
(GalR1) are found on ChAT somata and synapses, and may mediate the
breaking of vagal bradycardia as it is expressed strongly at the
sinoatrial (SA) node.^25^ Galanin is normally only co-expressed in \~5%
of TH somata in the stellate, however after injury, its levels are
increased to almost all neurons within 72 hours.^25^

The direct effect of sympathetic firing is through the release of NE,
which can bind to four different adrenergic receptors (AR). B1 and B2
adrenergic recept

vi. B1 and B2 adrenergic receptors are present in cardiac myocytes at
    sympathetic synaptic terminals; B1AR accumulate at synapses, while
    B2AR undergo endocytosis/internalization. (Shcherbakova et
    al., 2007) Beta-agonists lead to increase in cardiac mass through
    increased size of cardiac myocytes. (Franzoso, Zaglia, & Mongillo,
    2016; Zaglia et al., 2013)

vii. Almost all cardiomyocytes are in contact with sympathetic neurons
    (similar proportion to contact c- capillaries). (Hirsch et
    al., 2013) Basal/trophic sympathetic release leads to cardiomyocyte
    eutrophy (loss of beta-agonism leads to atrophy).

Cardiomyopathy
--------------

2.  Increased sympathetic tone in ischemic HF models (porcine) improves
    myocardial contraction, decreased oxygen consumption, decreases
    intraventricular desynchrony, all without elevation of NE. (Liu et
    al., 2012)

3.  After developing late-stage HF, neuronal bodies become hypertrophied
    and edematous. They become less excitable and may lead to vagal
    withdrawal. (Singh et al., 2013)

4.  In both ischemic and dilated CM...B1 receptor downregulation
    (proportion of subtypes are the same compared to healthy).
    Transmural distribution is different, c- lower B1 receptors found in
    subendocardium. (Beau, Tolley, & Saffitz, 1993)

5.  Cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) causes minimal increase
    in contractility, but has increased peripheral vasoconstriction
    (compared to rat controls). CSAR can be inhibited by epicardial
    lidocaine -- decreased contractility more in HF rats than control
    (also caused drop in LVEDP paradoxically). (Wang, Rozanski, &
    Zucker, 2017)

    g.  Myocardial contractility

        viii. NE release by the heavily sympathetically-innervated
            myocardium leads to Ca++ channel activity and ryanodine
            receptor (RyR), which leads to increased cytosolic Ca++.
            Effect is increased inotropy/lusitropy. (Shan et al., 2010)
            Sympathetic stimuli with NE at SA node also leads to
            increased myocardial interstitial levels of NE, which lead
            to ventricular inotropy.

<!-- -->

a.  Electrical conduction

    ix. Chronotropy/dromotropy

        9.  SA node firing rate depends on "funny current", which has
            inward-rectifying Na+ current that leads to depolarization
            through the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic
            nucleotide-gated channel (HCN). Sympathetic tone leads to
            dromotropy/chronotropy through increased HCN activity,
            spontaneous SA depolarization rate, and sarcoplasmic
            reticulum release of Ca++, as well increased depolarization
            through other neuronal bundles (e.g. His bundle, AV node,
            etc). (Franzoso et al., 2016; Liao, Lockhead, Larson, &
            Proenza, 2010)

    x.  Repolarization

        10. Effective refractory period (ERP) are shorted by sympathetic
            excitation, while sympathetic inhibition prolongs ERP...
            similar in endocardium/epicardium. (Martins & Zipes, 1980)
            Transmural dispersion of repolarization also shortened by
            sympathetic activity, prolonged by beta-blockade. (Dukes &
            Vaughan Williams, 1984)
