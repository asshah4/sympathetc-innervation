OUTLINE: THE SYMPATHETIC INNERVATION OF THE HEART
=================================================

1.  Introduction

    a.  Background

        i.  Neurocardiac axis mediates connection between brain and
            heart

    b.  Purpose

        ii. Teach clinicians that sympathetic nervous system is
            important in normal function as well as pathophysiologic
            states

        iii. Share how the heart and autonomic system was not built to
            respond to

        iv. Explore the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology
            relevance of sympathetic outflow to the heart

    c.  Objectives

        v.  Understand how the sympathetic nervous system innervates the
            heart

        vi. Understand how sympathetic tone effects the functions of the
            heart (such as chronotropy, inotropy, lusitropy, dromotropy)

        vii. Review how sympathetic dysfunction occurs in pathological
            states, such as VT/VF, MI, and stress cardiomyopathy.

2.  Anatomic and physiologic considerations

    d.  Overview of section

        viii. Sympathetic nervous system has three "distinct" levels,
            the brain and spinal cord, the thoracic/extracardiac
            ganglia, and the intrinsic cardiac nervous system

        ix. Carry both afferent and efferent information, integrates
            that at multiple levels

    e.  Spinal cord level

        x.  Spinal cord anatomy of preganglionic neurons location, and
            both proximal and distal connections to brain and
            postganglionic neurons

            1.  Automaticity and firing of these SNS neurons

        xi. Effect of cerebral/nervous influences on these preganglionic
            cell bodies

            2.  Examples include sympathetic storm from TBI, which leads
                to hyperactivation

            3.  Nervous activity (e.g. panic attack) on the
                preganglionic bodies (what is the connection/mechanism
                of communicatin)

        xii. Integration of systemic/peripheral reflex arcs into the
            spinal cord

            4.  Examples include vasovagal syncope, mesenteric ganglia
                response to stress, etc (lumbosacral outflow)

    f.  Thoracic, extracardiac level

        xiii. Anatomy of the thoracic ganglia

            5.  Preganglionic fibers exit from DRG and enter white rami,
                then eventually form sympathetic chain and thoracic
                ganglia

            6.  T1 to T6 specifically are responsible for cardiac
                outflow

        xiv. Stellate ganglia

            7.  Historic examples include stellectomy/ganglion block to
                help decrease VT/VF burden

            8.  Innervation of the heart is different between LSG and
                RSG, to some degree

    g.  Intrinsic cardiac level

        xv. Sympathetic nervous system is within GPs around epicardium
            of heart, particularly in epicardial fat pads.

        xvi. Innervation of the cardiac chambers and wall

            9.  Epicardium is highest density of nerve fibers, which
                decrease as going into endocardium

            10. Atria have different right-to-left innervation of both
                adrenergic and cholinergic nerves

            11. Ventricles have a base-to-apex density gradient of
                adrenergic fibers, but barely any vagal fibers (except
                inferior wall)

        xvii. Coronary artery innervation goes from a plexus around
            major/large arteries, and decreases in size until it is only
            1-2 nerves at level of arteriole

3.  Ventricular fibrillatory threshold

    h.  Pertinent history of SCD

        xviii.  SCD occurs with increased sympathetic tone

            12. Historical studies about emotional and stress triggers

        xix. Lown et al showed increased SNS leads to VT/VF in humans

        xx. Increased PVC during times of stress and increased SNS
            activity in human recordings

        xxi. VF threshold is modulated by different factors (mainly SNS
            activity)

            13. Increased likelihood of ventricular dysrhythmias of the
                heart

    i.  Normal effects of sympathetic tone through stellate ganglia
        stimulation

        xxii. Increased SNS (e.g. stellate stimulation) leads to
            increased inotropy/lusitropy

        xxiii.  RSG stimulation leads to increased SA firing, thus
            increased chronotropy/dromotropy

        xxiv. Increased stimulation leads to increased episodes of VT/VF
            (excluding effects of ischemia)

4.  Coronary perfusion

    j.  Myocardial infarction/ischemia

        xxv. Advent of MI can change and increase VT/VF events

        xxvi. Infarction leads to rewiring of the heart, including NE
            release

        xxvii.  Beta blockers, CCU "quiet and calm" can prevent
            sympathetic dysregulation

    k.  Cardiac innervation heterogeneity

        xxviii.   Localized changes occur after infarct, included
            denervation

            14. FIGURE: myocardial ischemia leads to interdigitations of
                non-ischemic regions

        xxix. Scar tissue development becomes a nidus for VT/VF

            15. Benefit of epicardial ablation at times

        xxx. Adrenergic receptor dysregulation after ischemia

5.  Catecholamine-based necrosis

    l.  Malignant effects of catecholamines

        xxxi. Takotsubo to discuss apical ballooning

            16. Mortality with Takotsubo is same with traditional AcS

        xxxii.  Wellen's T waves occur in setting of significant apical
            NE levels

            17. Stress events

            18. Cerebral injury

        xxxiii.   Effect of adrenergic receptor density on apex of the
            heart

    m.  Important neurotransmitters that mediate sympathetic tone

        xxxiv.  Sympathetic signals

            19. NE

                a.  Alpha and beta adrenergic receptors have
                    differential preference of location

            20. Galanin

            21. NPY

        xxxv. Parasympathetic signals

            22. Ach

            23. NOS
